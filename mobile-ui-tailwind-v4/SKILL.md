# Mobile UI Tailwind V4

## Overview

This skill is designed to accelerate the development of mobile-first user interfaces for React applications, focusing on modern aesthetics, good user experience (UX), and responsiveness. It utilizes Tailwind CSS v4 for styling and integrates with `shadcn` components to provide a robust and customizable foundation. The goal is to generate cohesive, simple, and up-to-date UI elements and layouts.

## Core Capabilities

### 1. React Component Generation with shadcn/ui

Generate a wide range of common mobile UI components (e.g., buttons, cards, navigation bars, forms, lists, modals) as React components. These components will be based on `shadcn/ui`, allowing for easy customization and adherence to modern design principles. The skill can also assist in tweaking existing `shadcn/ui` components to fit specific project needs.

### 2. Responsive Mobile Layout Generation

Create aesthetic and simple responsive layouts tailored for mobile devices. This includes patterns for headers, footers, content areas, and adaptive designs that ensure a great user experience across different mobile screen sizes.

### 3. Tailwind CSS v4 Integration and Best Practices

Provides guidance, examples, and code snippets demonstrating the effective use of Tailwind CSS v4. This includes:
- Utility-first class application for rapid styling.
- Responsive design breakpoints for mobile-first development.
- Custom theme configurations for cohesive branding.
- Ensuring consistency and cohesion across all generated UI elements.

## Resources

This skill includes example resource directories that demonstrate how to organize different types of bundled resources:
### scripts/
Executable code that can be run directly to perform specific operations.

**Examples from other skills:**
- PDF skill: fill_fillable_fields.cjs, extract_form_field_info.cjs - utilities for PDF manipulation
- CSV skill: normalize_schema.cjs, merge_datasets.cjs - utilities for tabular data manipulation

**Appropriate for:** Node.cjs scripts (cjs), shell scripts, or any executable code that performs automation, data processing, or specific operations.

**Note:** Scripts may be executed without loading into context, but can still be read by Gemini CLI for patching or environment adjustments.

### references/
Documentation and reference material intended to be loaded into context to inform Gemini CLI's process and thinking.

**Examples from other skills:**
- Product management: communication.md, context_building.md - detailed workflow guides
- BigQuery: API reference documentation and query examples
- Finance: Schema documentation, company policies

**Appropriate for:** In-depth documentation, API references, database schemas, comprehensive guides, or any detailed information that Gemini CLI should reference while working.

### assets/
Files not intended to be loaded into context, but rather used within the output Gemini CLI produces.

**Examples from other skills:**
- Brand styling: PowerPoint template files (.pptx), logo files
- Frontend builder: HTML/React boilerplate project directories
- Typography: Font files (.ttf, .woff2)

**Appropriate for:** Templates, boilerplate code, document templates, images, icons, fonts, or any files meant to be copied or used in the final output.

**Any unneeded directories can be deleted.** Not every skill requires all three types of resources.
